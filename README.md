# pythonPasswordGen
## Note: I am going to be re-making this in Rust.
### If you are here because of the placeholder in my Rust version which is not yet complete, you can run this program to get an idea of what the Rust version is going to do.
A password generator made in Python 3

This is just a project my friend and I were working on a while ago.
The last change to this project is this README.md, other than that,
this project is mainly up here for people who like Python 3 and who
wanna see how those random password generators work.
